## Introduction

The projects inside this repository represent my initial foray into programming. Please be aware that the code in these projects
is very basic and contains a lot of flaws and anti-patterns. They serve as learning experiences and stepping stones in my programming journey that started in 2017.
I am proud to have them found and restored six years after finishing my projects in c#.
